# Schoolwork
My programming assignments from school courses

# General notes:
Wherever there’s a folder named ‘julkinen’, it contains the parts of the program given by the course staff. The folders include also the given assignment. The comments and documentation of the SSH-client and concurrency assignment are in Finnish, the rest are in English. The programming language in all of them is C++.

Essay on SAT solvers:
This was a voluntary essay on the course Mathematical Logic. SAT solvers are algorithms that solve the Boolean satisfiability problem, which is NP-complete. I got full points on the essay (6/6).

SSH-client:
This is perhaps my largest project yet. It was done in pairs, but due to things beyond my control, I ended up doing most of the work. Normally, without extra features, maximum points would have been 4 out of 5, but the course staff took into account my disproportionate amount of work and gave me full points (5/5). The parts I did can be found in the documentation.

Concurrency:
The course in concurrency included a relatively small assingment, in which we implemented a simple concurrent server in pairs. This time the workload was divided much more evenly, and we both worked on most parts, so it can’t really be said which ones are mine.

Data Structures and Algorithms:
The course included three assignments, all of which were done independently. The main programs (basically handling input and output) and the interfaces for the data structures were given by the course staff. 

Grading was done with emphasis on efficiency, but style was also taken into account. I got full points on all three (6/6), and an extra point in the last one for early submission.

Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures:
The course was mainly based on weekly exercises, but also included a voluntary assignment. Compared to others it had little constraints, and the emphasis was again on efficiency. I got 2,5/3 points. The reduction was because I had some text output when prompting input, which made manual testing easier but failed some automatic tests by the course staff.
